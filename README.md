# Aim-Lock-Fire Game by Moiz Siddiqui

An innovative take on the classic Pong game, built using **Pygame**, where players shoot projectiles instead of bouncing a ball. This engaging game offers both **Single Player** and **Multiplayer** modes, combining strategy and precision to score points.

- **Shooting Mechanism**: Instead of bouncing a ball, players shoot projectiles across the screen to score.
- **Replay Prompt**: After each game, players are prompted to choose whether to play again or quit.

### **Controls**
- **Single Player**:
  - Player: Use arrow keys for movement and designated keys for shooting.
- **Multiplayer**:
  - Player 1: Use arrow keys for movement and actions.
  - Player 2: Use WASD keys for movement and actions.
